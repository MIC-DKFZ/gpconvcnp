# Neural Processes

This repository implements different Neural Process flavors. These works are currently integrated.

* Conditional Neural Processes ([Garnelo et al., ICML 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01613))
* Neural Processes ([Garnelo et al., ICML Workshop 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.01622))
* Attentive Neural Processes ([Kim et al., ICLR 2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05761))
* Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes ([Gordon, Bruinsma et al., ICLR 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13556))
